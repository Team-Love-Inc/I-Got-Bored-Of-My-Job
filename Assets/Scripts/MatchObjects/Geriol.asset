  description: "Geriol lived in a closed off community along the longest river in
    the country were 90% of the population were Frog-Men. He lived in a lovefilled
    family and tight-knit neighborhood where Frog-Man tradition is held strongly
    and their diet almost consist of bugs and flies from nature, especially flies
    being almost like catnip.\r\n\r\nGeriol always had a thing for trinkets and math,
    things not very associated in his community. With the recent boost of computer
    technology he took a big gambled - He applied for a university in the big city
    and got accepted! Leaving everything he knew for the new and wider world.\r"
