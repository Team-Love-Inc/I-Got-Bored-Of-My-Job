  description: "Geriol lived in a closed off community along the longest river in
    the country were 90% of the population were Frog-Men. He lived in a lovefilled
    family and tight-knit neighborhood where Frog-Man tradition is held strongly
    and their diet almost consist of bugs and flies from nature, especially flies
    being almost like catnip.\r\n\r\nGeriol always had a thing for trinkets and math,
    things not very associated in his community. With the recent boost of computer
    technology he took a big gambled - He applied for a university in the big city
    and got accepted! Leaving everything he knew for the new and wider world.\r\n\r\n2
    years in though and he still haven\u2019t acclimated with his environment. The
    Frog-Man tradition and bug eating habit is giving other people a weird look,
    so he has tried to suppress those habits.\r\nStill, he barely has any friends
    and is spending most of his time working and studying at home. It changed when
    he looked himself in the mirror one day and noticed a wrinkle, a sign of his
    life advancing but with barely any real life experience to show for it. Now he
    really want to change that for real - He is going to get out there! Find experiences
    and even some LOVE!\r\n\r\nHopefully a fly won\u2019t fly near him that he can\u2019t
    resist.\r\n\nGeriol lived in a closed off community along the longest river in
